# jelly-substitute
A Stardew Valley mod which makes it so that your weekly produce giveaway is not interpreted as marital infidelity.

Seriously, you'd think you could at least have a talk about this, especially when the farmer's entire personality from the perspective of the NPC's is running around throwing produce at everyone.

The source is in ModEntry.cs
